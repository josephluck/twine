# Another state management lib

Warning: this isn't a finished library! Use with caution.

## For:
- People who don't like flux standard actions with magic 'dispatch' methods
- People who use typescript and want their state management fully typed thoughout their app

## Examples:
The easiest way to see the API is by looking at [the tests](src/store.spec.js)!
